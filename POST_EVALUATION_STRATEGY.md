# Post-Evaluation Success Strategy

## Phase 1: Approaching the Pass Mark (80-95% to Target)

### 🎯 When You're at $10,800-$10,950 (Need $50-$200 More)

#### IMMEDIATE ADJUSTMENTS
```python
if account_balance >= 10800:  # 80% to target
    # Reduce risk dramatically
    risk_per_trade = 0.5%  # Down from 1.5%
    max_daily_trades = 2    # Down from 3-5
    min_rr_ratio = 3.0      # Up from 1.5
    
    # Only trade A+ setups
    required_confluence = 4  # Multiple confirmations needed
    only_preferred_symbols = True  # BTC, SOL, DOT only
```

#### Capital Preservation Mode
1. **Risk Reduction**
   - Cut position size to 0.5% max risk
   - Target smaller, consistent gains ($50-$100)
   - No revenge trading after any loss

2. **Trade Selection**
   - Only take trades with 3:1 RR or better
   - Wait for perfect setups (all indicators align)
   - Maximum 2 trades per day

3. **Time Management**
   - Trade only during optimal hours (high volume)
   - Skip Fridays and weekends (higher volatility)
   - Take breaks after each trade to reassess

4. **The "Grind It Out" Approach**
   ```
   Remaining: $150
   Strategy: 3 trades × $50 profit each
   Risk: $50 per trade (0.5%)
   RR Ratio: 1:1 minimum
   Success Rate Needed: 60% (easier with perfect setups)
   ```

## Phase 2: After Passing - The Funded Account

### 📊 Immediate Post-Pass Strategy (First 30 Days)

#### CRITICAL MINDSET SHIFT
```
Evaluation Phase: "I need to make money fast"
Funded Phase: "I need to never lose this account"
```

### New Risk Parameters for Funded Account
```python
# Funded Account Configuration
FUNDED_ACCOUNT_CONFIG = {
    'initial_balance': 10000,
    'risk_per_trade': 0.75,     # Half of evaluation risk
    'max_daily_loss': 250,       # Half of evaluation limit
    'max_drawdown': 400,         # More conservative
    'profit_target_monthly': 300, # 3% per month is excellent
    'max_daily_trades': 2,
    'compound_profits': False,    # Not initially
}
```

### 📈 The "Consistency First" Approach

#### Month 1-3: Prove Consistency
- **Goal**: $300-500 per month (3-5%)
- **Focus**: Build track record, not big profits
- **Risk**: 0.75% per trade maximum
- **Trades**: Quality over quantity (20-30 per month)

#### Month 4-6: Gradual Scaling
- **Goal**: $500-750 per month (5-7.5%)
- **Risk**: 1% per trade (if profitable in first 3 months)
- **Focus**: Refine strategy, identify best setups
- **Document**: Every trade for pattern recognition

#### Month 7-12: Optimization
- **Goal**: $750-1000 per month (7.5-10%)
- **Risk**: 1.25% per trade (with proven track record)
- **Focus**: Consistency for scaling plan eligibility
- **Prepare**: For account size increase

## Phase 3: Scaling Strategy (Breakout Prop Specific)

### 🚀 Achieving 95% Profit Split

Breakout Prop offers scaling up to 95% profit split. Here's how:

#### Requirements (Typical):
1. **3+ Months Profitable Trading**
2. **No Daily Loss Limit Breaches**
3. **Consistent Monthly Returns** (3-5% minimum)
4. **Professional Risk Management**

#### Scaling Milestones:
```
Phase 1 (Month 1-3):  80% split, $10k account
Phase 2 (Month 4-6):  85% split, $25k account (if eligible)
Phase 3 (Month 7-9):  90% split, $50k account (if eligible)
Phase 4 (Month 10+):  95% split, $100k account (if eligible)
```

### 📊 Compound Growth Strategy

#### Without Compounding (Safe):
- Month 1: $10,000 → +$300 = $10,300 (withdraw $240)
- Month 2: $10,000 → +$300 = $10,300 (withdraw $240)
- Monthly Income: $240 (80% of $300)

#### With Scaling (Optimal):
- Month 1-3: $10k account → $720 income (3×$300×80%)
- Month 4-6: $25k account → $2,250 income (3×$750×85%)
- Month 7-9: $50k account → $5,400 income (3×$1,500×90%)
- Month 10-12: $100k account → $11,400 income (3×$3,000×95%)

**Year 1 Total: $19,770** (vs $2,880 without scaling)

## Phase 4: Long-Term Sustainability

### 🛡️ Risk Management Evolution

#### The "Never Breach" System
```python
class FundedAccountManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.daily_loss_buffer = 100  # Stop at $400 loss (not $500)
        self.drawdown_buffer = 150    # Stop at $450 DD (not $600)
        self.profit_lock = True        # Lock profits weekly
        
    def weekly_profit_lock(self, current_balance):
        if current_balance > self.last_week_balance:
            profit = current_balance - self.last_week_balance
            self.withdraw_amount = profit * 0.5  # Withdraw 50%
            self.locked_profit += profit * 0.5   # Keep 50% as buffer
```

### 📈 Advanced Strategies for Funded Accounts

#### 1. The "Base Hit" Strategy
- Target: 10-20 pips per trade (crypto: 0.5-1% moves)
- Frequency: 1-2 trades daily
- Risk: 0.5% per trade
- Monthly Goal: 3% (60-80 small wins)

#### 2. The "Weekly Target" System
```
Week 1: Target $75 (0.75%)
Week 2: Target $75 (0.75%)
Week 3: Target $75 (0.75%)
Week 4: Target $75 (0.75%)
Total: $300 (3%) - Very achievable
```

#### 3. The "Pairs Rotation" Method
- Week 1: Trade only BTC
- Week 2: Trade only SOL
- Week 3: Trade only DOT
- Week 4: Trade best performer from weeks 1-3
- Benefit: Deep market knowledge per pair

### 🎯 Psychological Management

#### Common Pitfalls After Passing:
1. **Overconfidence** → Increase position sizes too quickly
2. **Complacency** → Less careful with entries
3. **Pressure** → Feel need to make big profits
4. **Fear** → Too conservative, missing opportunities

#### Mental Framework for Success:
```
Daily Mantra:
"I am a risk manager first, trader second"
"Small consistent profits compound to wealth"
"Protecting capital is winning"
"Every day survived is progress"
```
