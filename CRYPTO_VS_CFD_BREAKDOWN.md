- 🚩 Uses MT4/MT5 platform
- 🚩 Offers "BTC/USD" as a forex pair
- 🚩 Market closes on weekends
- 🚩 Leverage limited to 1:2 or 1:3
- 🚩 Groups crypto with "forex majors"
- 🚩 No mention of exchanges

### Green Flags (It's Real Crypto):

## 💡 **Why This Matters for Your Strategy**

### If You Use CFDs (MT4/MT5):
```python
# Your signals work differently
- Entry: Might gap on Monday open
- Stop Loss: Weekend gaps can bypass
- Liquidity: Depends on broker
- Execution: Instant but synthetic
- Costs: Spreads + swap fees
```

### If You Use Real Crypto (CEX):
```python
# Your signals work as intended
- Entry: Executes 24/7
- Stop Loss: Always active
- Liquidity: Real market depth
- Execution: Real slippage/fills
- Costs: Maker/taker + funding
```

## 📋 **Quick Reference**

| What You Want | Choose This | Avoid This |
|--------------|------------|------------|
| Real crypto markets | Breakout, CFT, BluSky | FTMO, FundedNext |
| Full automation | FTMO, FundedNext | Breakout (currently) |
| 24/7 trading | Any crypto-native firm | MT4/MT5 firms |
| Perpetual futures | Breakout, CFT | All forex firms |
| Cheap testing | DNA Funded ($49) | Expensive evaluations |
| Best reputation | FTMO | Newer crypto firms |

---

## 🎬 **Bottom Line**

**Your current Breakout Prop = REAL CRYPTO** ✅
- Trading actual perpetual futures
- On real exchanges (OKX/Bybit)

**FTMO/FundedNext = FAKE CRYPTO** ❌

**The Question**: Is automation worth switching from real to fake crypto markets?

**My Take**: Start building semi-automation for Breakout while testing full automation with a cheap CFD firm. Best of both worlds!
