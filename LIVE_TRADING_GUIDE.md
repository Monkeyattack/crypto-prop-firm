## üéØ Key Takeaway

**The transition to live trading should be gradual, methodical, and heavily risk-managed. Most successful traders spend 3-6 months in paper trading before risking real money. There's no rush - your capital preservation is more important than potential profits.**

Remember: You can always make more money, but you can't get back lost capital. Start small, scale gradually, and never risk more than you can afford to lose.
